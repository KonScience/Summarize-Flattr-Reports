Summarize Flattr Reports
---
R script to create summary CSV files and diagrams from Flattr's Monthly Revenue reports.

Usage Instructions
---
1. In [your "Transactions"-list on Flattr](https://flattr.com/dashboard/transactions), open each "Monthly revenue"-report, click "Download as CSV"and save them to a folder of your choice.
1. Download [this script](https://github.com/KonScience/Summarise-Flattr-Reports/blob/master/summarise-flattr-reports.R) to the same or any other folder.
1. Download [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and install.
1. Open the script (.r file) in RStudio, select all code by pressing CMD+A and run it with CMD+Return (should take just a few seconds). Afterwards, find the summary files and diagrams in the same folder as the .csv files you downloaded from Flattr.
1. If you have more than 40-50 Flattr things and/or more than 18-24 monthly reports, increase `height` and `width` parameters in `ggsave` function(s). Expect some trial & error until you find fitting values.
1. Please contribute ideas, criticism and code, by [opening an issue](https://github.com/KonScience/Summarize-Flattr-Reports/issues/new) or [forking](https://github.com/KonScience/Summarize-Flattr-Reports/fork) and sending a pull request.

Ideas
---
- ~~sort data usefully~~ [DONE](https://github.com/KonScience/Summarize-Flattr-Reports/pull/1)
- simplify data input (~~better file/folder selection~~ [DONE](https://github.com/KonScience/Summarize-Flattr-Reports/commit/c4b8f15d4d0bdb8001b3a7255bb71077e76b8638), or automatic download from flattr.com)
  - also read out withdrawals & draw Flattr "balance" diagram
- draw more useful diagrams
  - ~~coloration of datapoints per Flattr thing~~ [DONE](https://github.com/KonScience/Summarize-Flattr-Reports/commit/1e5ddef18fa89015688f3b9d3dc30db35c2b8652?diff=unified#diff-aecf3d2d8db8e5ca05c6f01653041e00L68)
  - auto-determine useful diagram dimensions
  - improve visualisation for very large datasets
- summarise Flattr clicks per month, not ordered by thing
- predictions (anybody knows the statistics behind this?)
- episodes vs. other things (probably needs reg-ex on slugs)
- webapp via Shiny that processes given data for a Flattr-click
- install on server to auto-run & publish diagram 

Thanks and Greetings :-)
